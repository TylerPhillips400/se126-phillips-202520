#PROMPT: Access the words.csv file and store the data to a dictionary, where each word in the file is a key of the dictionary and the value stored to each key is the wordâ€™s corresponding definition. Then, create a repeatable program that allows a user to interact with the dictionary.

#VARIABLE DICTIONARY:
#csvfile            Storing the relative path from the CSV file
#file               Passing the CSV file to the reader method
#rec                Processing all records in the CSV file
#i                  Index of each field of data from all records
#j                  Placeholder for index swaping for alphabetical order
#listname           list name for the swap() to bubble sort
#temp               temp variable for bubble sort swap()
#words              All words from the CSV file appened into a list
#definition         All definitions from the CSV file appened into a list
#dictionary         Dictionary updated by using the first record : 2nd record
#ans                Askes user if they would like to enter the dictionary program and allows the program to loop [input]
#search_type        Askes user what they would like to do in the search menu [input]
#key                Key is the firt record or word that correlates to the definition
#found              Variable containing the found item for displaying a word that is searched for
#new_word           Askes user what new word they would like to add [input]
#new_def            Askes user what the definition of the new word they added was [input]
